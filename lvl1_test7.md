The Nautilus DevOps team successfully deployed a Redis application on the Kubernetes cluster last week. However, this morning, modifications were being made to the existing setup by one of our team members. Unfortunately, errors occurred during these changes, causing the application to go offline.


The deployment named redis-deployment-t4q2 is currently experiencing issues, resulting in the pods being unavailable. Your task is to troubleshoot this issue and restore the deployment to ensure the pods are in a running state again.

Please proceed with diagnosing the problem and implementing the necessary fixes to bring the redis-deployment-t4q2 back to a functional state.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

'redis-deployment-t4q2' deployment exists

Pods are in running state

Redis is responding fine
