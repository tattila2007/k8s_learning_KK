1.
Create a Pod mc-pod in the mc-namespace namespace with three containers. 
The first container should be named mc-pod-1, run the nginx:1-alpine image, and set an environment variable NODE_NAME to the node name. 
The second container should be named mc-pod-2, run the busybox:1 image, and continuously log the output of the date command to the file /var/log/shared/date.log every second. 
The third container should have the name mc-pod-3, run the image busybox:1, and print the contents of the date.log file generated by the second container to stdout. 
Use a shared, non-persistent volume.

2.
Create a service messaging-service to expose the messaging application within the cluster on port 6379.
Use imperative commands.

3.
Create a deployment named hr-web-app using the image kodekloud/webapp-color with 2 replicas.

4.
Expose the hr-web-app created in the previous task as a service named hr-web-app-service, accessible on port 30082 on the nodes of the cluster.
The web application listens on port 8080.

5.
Create a Persistent Volume with the given specification: -
Volume name: pv-analytics
Storage: 100Mi
Access mode: ReadWriteMany
Host path: /pv/data-analytics

6.
Create a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with name webapp-hpa for the deployment named kkapp-deploy in the default namespace with the webapp-hpa.yaml file located under the root folder.
Ensure that the HPA scales the deployment based on CPU utilization, maintaining an average CPU usage of 50% across all pods.
Configure the HPA to cautiously scale down pods by setting a stabilization window of 300 seconds to prevent rapid fluctuations in pod count.

Note: The kkapp-deploy deployment is created for backend; you can check in the terminal.

7.
Deploy a Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) with name analytics-vpa for the deployment named analytics-deployment in the default namespace.
The VPA should automatically adjust the CPU and memory requests of the pods to optimize resource utilization. 
Ensure that the VPA operates in Auto mode, allowing it to evict and recreate pods with updated resource requests as needed.

8.
Create a Kubernetes Gateway resource with the following specifications:

Name: web-gateway
Namespace: nginx-gateway
Gateway Class Name: nginx
Listeners:
Protocol: HTTP
Port: 80
Name: http

9.
One co-worker deployed an nginx helm chart kk-mock1 in the kk-ns namespace on the cluster. 
A new update is pushed to the helm chart, and the team wants you to update the helm repository to fetch the new changes.
After updating the helm chart, upgrade the helm chart version to 18.1.15.
