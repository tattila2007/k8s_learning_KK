* Create a Pod mc-pod in the *mc-namespace* namespace with three containers. 
* The first container should be named *mc-pod-1* , run the *nginx:1-alpine* image, and set an environment variable **NODE_NAME** to the node name. 
* The second container should be named *mc-pod-2*, run the *busybox:1* image, and continuously log the output of the date command to the file /var/log/shared/date.log every second. 
* The third container should have the name *mc-pod-3* , run the image *busybox:1* , and print the contents of the date.log file generated by the second container to stdout. 
* Use a shared, non-persistent volume.

** Is the pod environment variable correctly set?
** Does the Sidecar display logs?

* This question needs to be solved on node *node01*. To access the node using SSH, use the credentials below:

username: bob
password: caleston123

* As an administrator, you need to prepare *node01* to install kubernetes. 
* One of the steps is installing a container runtime. 
* Install the *cri-docker_0.3.16.3-0.debian.deb* package located in /root and ensure that the cri-docker service is running and enabled to start on boot.


** Is the package installed successfully on node01?
** Is the service running?
** Is the service enabled?

* Create a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with name webapp-hpa for the deployment named kkapp-deploy in the default namespace with the webapp-hpa.yaml file located under the root folder.
* Ensure that the HPA scales the deployment based on CPU utilization, maintaining an average CPU usage of 50% across all pods.
* Configure the HPA to cautiously scale down pods by setting a stabilization window of 300 seconds to prevent rapid fluctuations in pod count.

* Note: The kkapp-deploy deployment is created for backend; you can check in the terminal.

* Is the HPA webapp-hpa deployed?
* Is the deployment configured for metrics CPU Utilization?
* Is the stabilization window set to 300 seconds?

* Deploy a Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) with name analytics-vpa for the deployment named analytics-deployment in the default namespace.
* The VPA should automatically adjust the CPU and memory requests of the pods to optimize resource utilization. 
* Ensure that the VPA operates in Auto mode, allowing it to evict and recreate pods with updated resource requests as needed.

* Is the VPA analytics-vpa created for deployment analytics-deployment?
* Is the updatePolicy set to Auto mode for deployment analytics-deployment?
